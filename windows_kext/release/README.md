# Kext release tool

### Generate the zip file
- Make sure `kextinterface/version.txt` is up to date
- Execute: `cargo run`  
  * This will generate release `kext_release_vX-X-X.zip` file. Which contains all the necessary files to make the release.  

### Generate the cab file
- Copy the zip and extract it on a windows machine.
  * Visual Studio 2022 and WDK need to be installed.
- From VS Command Prompt / PowerShell run:
```
cd kext_release_v.../
./build_cab.bat
```
> Script is written for VS `$SDK_Version = "10.0.22621.0"`. If different version is used update the script.

3. Sing the cab file
